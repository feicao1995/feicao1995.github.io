Currently a beginning Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. 
Hobbies: Naruto/Boruto, Detective Conan, NBA, Yu-Gi-Oh! (a trading card game, **I am a professional Yu-Gi-Oh! player by the way**), etc. 
Email: fcao@umass.edu. 
I am glad to discuss mathematics and potential research collaboration possibilities with you via email. 
I am interested in partial differential equations, stochastic processes, interacting particle systems, and theoretical machine learning. 
My Ph.D advisor is [Sebastien Motsch](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OY7cVvgAAAAJ&hl=en).
