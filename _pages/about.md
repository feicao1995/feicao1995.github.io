Currently an **Visiting Assistant Professor** at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am now on the job market and I am actively looking for a tenure-track position (in applied mathematics and/or related areas).
Hobbies: Naruto/Boruto, Detective Conan, NBA, Yu-Gi-Oh! (a trading card game, I am a semi-professional Yu-Gi-Oh! player by the way), etc. 
Email: fcao@umass.edu. 
I am glad to discuss mathematics and potential research collaboration possibilities with you via email. 
I am interested in partial differential equations, stochastic processes, interacting particle systems, and theoretical machine learning. 
My Ph.D advisor is [Sebastien Motsch](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OY7cVvgAAAAJ&hl=en). 
My CV can be found at [here](https://feicao1995.github.io/files/CV_FeiCao.pdf). Please always refer to my Google Scholar or Curriculum Vitae for my up-to-date publications and pre-prints.
