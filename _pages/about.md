Currently an **Visiting Researcher in Applied Mathematics** at Amherst College (until July 2026). I am now on the job market and **I am actively looking for a tenure-track position (in applied mathematics and/or related areas) starting at Spring 2026 or Fall 2026**.
I obtained my Ph.D in Applied Mathematics from Arizona State University in May 2022, and my Ph.D advisor is [Sebastien Motsch](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OY7cVvgAAAAJ&hl=en). From September 2022 to August 2025, I was an Visiting Assistant Professor
in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My hobbies include but not limited to: Naruto/Boruto, Detective Conan, NBA, Yu-Gi-Oh! 
(a trading card game, I am a die-hard Yu-Gi-Oh! player by the way, please feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in scheduling some online YuGiOh! duels in the Dueling Nexus platform), etc. My current Email address: fcao@amherst.edu. 
I am glad to discuss mathematics and potential research collaboration possibilities with you via email. 
I am interested in partial differential equations, stochastic processes, interacting particle systems, and theoretical machine learning. 
My CV can be found at [here](https://feicao1995.github.io/files/CV_FeiCao.pdf). Please always refer to my Google Scholar or Curriculum Vitae for my up-to-date publications and pre-prints.
